# Context, Features and Priorities

This document provides instructions for a mandatory computer lab session in the course ETSN15 "Requirements Engineering" given at Lund University. The source code of this page in markdown is available [here](https://github.com/reqT/reqT/blob/3.0.x/doc/lab1/lab1-2019.md).

## Goals

To complete this lab you should develop a requirements model using [reqT](http://reqt.org/download.html). Your requirements model should be based on your course project and it should include the following sections:

  * A **context** section including a draft product context of your course project with some relevant interfaces to some relevant actors. The model does not have to be complete.

  * A **features** section with at least 5 high-level features from your course project, each with a descriptive id. Each feature should also have a Gist attribute with a short description of the feature.

  * A **priorities** section with priorities for each feature based on the criteria: *which feature is most important to spend more elicitation effort on*.


## Task 0: Mandatory Preparations

* Draw an initial version of a context diagram for your project using some drawing tool, e.g. *LibreOffice Draw* and save it as `.png` or `.jpg` or `.svg`

* Select around 5 to 10 high-level features from your project and for each feature create a short description of one line of text.

* Name at least 2 stakeholders from your project.

* Make sure you can run reqT in terminal and launch the swing desktop gui using the `edit` command.

    * How to start reqT on the student Linux computers in the E building at LTH: [http://cs.lth.se/krav/reqt](http://cs.lth.se/krav/reqt)

    * How to download and run reqT on your own machine: [http://reqt.org/download.html](http://reqt.org/download.html)

* Study the slides of lectures L1-L4, especially those describing requirements modeling and reqT.

* Read chapter ??? of the reqt tutorial here TODO

* At the begining of the lab session contact a supervisor and be prepared to:

    * Show your context diagram and a list of your feature with one-line descriptions and stakeholders.

    * Answer these questions:

        * What is the difference between an entity and an attribute?

        * What can be connected with a relation?

## Task 1: Create a `context` section

* Launch reqT and open the swing desktop gui editor with the `edit` command in terminal.

* Create a textual model of your project context diagram from your lab preparatins in Task 0 above. Use entities in a similar way as in the example below.

```
Section context
  Product hotelApp interactsWith
    User receptionist
    User guest
    System accounting
    System telephony  
```

## Task 2: Create a `features` section  


## Task 3: Prioritize your features


## Task 4: Publish your model on the web

* Do this optional task if you still have time left at the lab session.

* Save your model as a web page.

    * You can generate html and save a web page of your model in the tree using the menu `Export -> To Html`.

    * You can generate html and save a web page of your model in the tree using this command in the `reqT` terminal: `currentTree.toHtml.save("index.html")`

* If you have an account on the student Linux computers in the E building at LTH, you can publish web pages if you create a folder called `public_html`. You can put `.html` files there for example called `index.html` inside that directory. Everyone can then access your page by surfing to ```http://users.student.lth.se/user/index.html``` where `user` is replaced with your login StilID. Here is a minimal `index.html` page:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello WÃ¶rld!
  </body>
</html>
```

* Include an `Image` attribute in your reqt model similar to `  Image("http://adress.to.your/page/ctx.jpg")` and reqT will then insert a link to your diagram in your html code when you export to html.
