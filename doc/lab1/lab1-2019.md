# Context, Features and Priorities

This document provides instructions for a mandatory computer lab session in the course ETSN15 "Requirements Engineering" given at Lund University.

## Goals

To complete this lab you should develop a requirements model using [reqT](http://reqt.org/download.html). Your requirements model should be based on your course project and it should include the following sections:

  * A **Context** section including a draft product context of your course project with some relevant interfaces to some relevant actors. The model does not have to be complete.

  * A **Features** section with at least 7 high-level features from your course project, each with a descriptive id. Each feature should also have a Gist attribute with a short description of the feature.

  * A **Priorities** section with priorities for each feature based on the criteria: *which feature is most important to spend more elicitation effort on*.


## Background

About requirements models, example entities, attributes and relations etc.

## Task 0: Mandatory Preparations

On how to download and start reqT and some basics about the editor.

## Task 1: Create a Context section

```
Section Context
  Product hotelApp interactsWith
    User receptionist
    User guest
    System accounting
  User guest interactsWith
    Product hotelApp
  User receptionist interactsWith
    Product hotelApp
  System telephony interactsWith
    Product hotelApp   
```

## Task 2: Create a Features section  


## Task 3: Prioritize Features


## Task 4 (optional): Publish your model in html

* If you have an account on the student computers in the E building at LTH, you can publish web pages if you create a folder called `public_html`. You can put a html files there, for example called `index.html` inside that directory. You can then surf to [http://student.lth.se/tts-bre/](http://student.lth.se/tts-bre/) where `tts-bre` is replaced with your login StilID. Here is a minimal html page:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello WÃ¶rld!
  </body>
</html>
```
