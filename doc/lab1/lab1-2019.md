# LAB 1: Context, Features and Priorities

This document provides instructions for a mandatory computer lab session in the course ETSN15 "Requirements Engineering" given at Lund University.

## Goals

To complete this lab you should develop a requirements model using [reqT](http://reqt.org/download.html). Your requirements model should be based on your course project and it should include the following sections:

  * A **Context** section including a draft product context of your course project with some relevant interfaces to some relevant actors. The model does not have to be complete.

  * A **Features** section with at least 7 high-level features from your course project, each with a descriptive id. Each feature should also have a Gist attribute with a short description of the feature.

  * A **Priorities** section with priorities for each feature based on the criteria: *which feature is most important to spend more elicitation effort on*.


## Background
