# Context, Features and Priorities

This document provides instructions for a mandatory computer lab session in the course ETSN15 "Requirements Engineering" given at Lund University.

## Goals

To complete this lab you should develop a requirements model using [reqT](http://reqt.org/download.html). Your requirements model should be based on your course project and it should include the following sections:

  * A **Context** section including a draft product context of your course project with some relevant interfaces to some relevant actors. The model does not have to be complete.

  * A **Features** section with at least 7 high-level features from your course project, each with a descriptive id. Each feature should also have a Gist attribute with a short description of the feature.

  * A **Priorities** section with priorities for each feature based on the criteria: *which feature is most important to spend more elicitation effort on*.


## Background

About requirements models, example entities, attributes and relations etc.

## Task 0: Mandatory Preparations

* Make sure you can run reqT in terminal and launch the swing desktop gui using the `edit` command.

    * How to start reqT on the student Linux computers in the E building at LTH: [http://cs.lth.se/krav/reqt](http://cs.lth.se/krav/reqt)

    * How to download and run reqT on your own machine: [http://reqt.org/download.html](http://cs.lth.se/krav/reqt)

* Study the slides from the reqT intro at lecture L3.

* Read chapter TODO of the reqt tutorial here TODO


## Task 1: Create a `context` section

```
Section Context
  Product hotelApp interactsWith
    User receptionist
    User guest
    System accounting
  User guest interactsWith
    Product hotelApp
  User receptionist interactsWith
    Product hotelApp
  System telephony interactsWith
    Product hotelApp   
```

## Task 2: Create a `features` section  


## Task 3: Prioritize your features


## Task 4: Publish your model on the web

* Do this optional task if you still have time left at the lab session.

* Save your model as a web page.

    * You can generate html and save a web page of your model in the tree using the menu `Export -> To Html`.

    * You can generate html and save a web page of your model in the tree using this command in the `reqT` terminal: `currentTree.toHtml.save("index.html")`

* If you have an account on the student Linux computers in the E building at LTH, you can publish web pages if you create a folder called `public_html`. You can put `.html` files there for example called `index.html` inside that directory. Everyone can then access your page by surfing to ```http://users.student.lth.se/user/index.html``` where `user` is replaced with your login StilID. Here is a minimal `index.html` page:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello WÃ¶rld!
  </body>
</html>
```
