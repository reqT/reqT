<p>This document provides instructions for a mandatory computer lab session in the course ETSN15 &quot;Requirements Engineering&quot; given at Lund University.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>To complete this lab you should develop a requirements model using <a href="http://reqt.org/download.html">reqT</a>. Your requirements model should be based on your course project and it should include the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <strong>Context</strong> section including a draft product context of your course project with some relevant interfaces to some relevant actors. The model does not have to be complete.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>Features</strong> section with at least 7 high-level features from your course project, each with a descriptive id. Each feature should also have a Gist attribute with a short description of the feature.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>Priorities</strong> section with priorities for each feature based on the criteria: <em>which feature is most important to spend more elicitation effort on</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>On student computers at LTH in the E building you can publish a homepage if you create a folder called <code>public_html</code> and put a file called <code>index.html</code> inside that directory. You can then surf to <a href="http://student.lth.se/tts-bre/" class="uri">http://student.lth.se/tts-bre/</a> where <code>tts-bre</code> is replaced with your login StilID. Here is a minimal html page:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span class="dt">&lt;!DOCTYPE </span>html<span class="dt">&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;head&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;meta</span><span class="ot"> charset=</span><span class="st">&quot;utf-8&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;title&gt;</span>Test<span class="kw">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;body&gt;</span>
Hello WÃ¶rld!
  <span class="kw">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/html&gt;</span></code></pre></div></li>
