<p>This document provides instructions for a mandatory computer lab session in the course ETSN15 &quot;Requirements Engineering&quot; given at Lund University.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>To complete this lab you should develop a requirements model using <a href="http://reqt.org/download.html">reqT</a>. Your requirements model should be based on your course project and it should include the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <strong>Context</strong> section including a draft product context of your course project with some relevant interfaces to some relevant actors. The model does not have to be complete.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>Features</strong> section with at least 7 high-level features from your course project, each with a descriptive id. Each feature should also have a Gist attribute with a short description of the feature.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>Priorities</strong> section with priorities for each feature based on the criteria: <em>which feature is most important to spend more elicitation effort on</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
