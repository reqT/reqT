# Quality Requirements and Release Planning

This document provides instructions for a mandatory computer lab session in the course ETSN15 "Requirements Engineering" given at Lund University.

## Goals

To complete this lab you should develop a requirements model using [reqT](http://reqt.org/download.html), based on your course project. Your model should include the following sections:

  * A **Quality** section including at least one quality requirement using open target, one quality requirement using open metric and at least one Quper model.

  * A **Plan** section with a release plan of least 5 high-level features allocated to at least 2 releases.


## Task 0: Mandatory Preparations

  * Study the course litterature related to quality requirements and release planneing, esp:

    * Read Chapter 6 on Quality Requirements in the course text book [Lauesen2001].

    * Look at the video lecture on [Quper from Öredev here.](http://cs.lth.se/krav/quality-requirements/)

    * Read the paper on quality requriements [**QUPER**] (download pdf on internal moodle page) Regnell, Björn, Richard Berntsson Svensson, and Thomas Olsson. "Supporting roadmapping of quality requirements." IEEE software 25.2 (2008). doi: 10.1109/MS.2008.48

    * Read the book chapter on product management [**PRMAN**] (download pdf on internal moodle page) Fricker, Samuel A. "Software product management." Software for People. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2012. 53-81. pdf

    * Read the paper on release planning [**RP**] (download pdf on internal moodle page) Ruhe, Gunther, and Moshood Omolade Saliu. "The art and science of software release planning." IEEE software 22.6 (2005): 47-53.  doi: 10.1109/MS.2005.164

  * **Select and write down** at least three quality requirements relevant to your course project. They should cover at least two different types of quality aspects (e.g. capacity, accuracy, performance, security, usability, ...).

  * **Select and write down** 3 features and 2 stakeholders from your project and make estimates of relative *benefit* for each feature from the viewpoint of each stakeholder, and estimates of relative *cost* for each feature from development and test perspectives, e.g. using e.g. the 100$-method from [lab1](http://cs.lth.se/krav/labs/lab1). Use fictitious estimates if necessary but aim to be realistic if possible.  

  | Stakeholder | Feature | Benefit |
  |-------------|---------|---------|
  | X | f1 | 4 |
  | X | f2 | 2 |
  | X | f3 | 1 |
  | Y | f1 | 2 |
  | Y | f2 | 1 |
  | Y | f3 | 1 |

  | Resource | Feature | Cost |
  |----------|---------|------|
  | dev | f1 | 10 |
  | dev | f2 | 70 |
  | dev | f3 | 40 |
  | test | f1 | 40 |
  | test | f2 | 10 |
  | test | f3 | 70 |



## Task 1: Create Quality Requirements

* Create a model i the reqT tree including a `Section("quality")`.

* Add a quality requirements `Quality("someId1") has Spec("blabla")` relevant for your project with a specification using the *open target* style [Lau, Chapter 6]. What type of quality aspect are you specifying?

* Add a quality requirements `Quality("someId2") has Spec("blabla")` relevant for your project with a specification using the *open metric* style [Lau, Chapter 6]. What type of quality aspect are you specifying?

* Based on the template in the `Templates -> Quper`, create a Quper model relevant to your project with at least two different targets. Use fictitious estimates if necessary but aim to be realistic if possible.


## Task 2: Create a Release Plan
