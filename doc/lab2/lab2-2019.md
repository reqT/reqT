# Quality Requirements and Release Planning

This document provides instructions for a mandatory computer lab session in the course ETSN15 "Requirements Engineering" given at Lund University.

## Goals

To complete this lab you should develop a requirements model using [reqT](http://reqt.org/download.html), based on your course project. Your model should include the following sections:

  * A **Quality** section including at least one quality requirement using open target, one quality requirement using open metric and at least one Quper model.

  * A **Plan** section with a release plan of least 5 high-level features allocated to at least 2 releases.


## Task 0: Mandatory Preparations

  * Read Chapter 6 on Quality Requirements in the course text book [Lauesen2001].

  * Look at the video lecture on [Quper from Öredev here.](http://cs.lth.se/krav/quality-requirements/)

  * Read the paper on quality requriements [**QUPER**] (download pdf on internal moodle page) Regnell, Björn, Richard Berntsson Svensson, and Thomas Olsson. "Supporting roadmapping of quality requirements." IEEE software 25.2 (2008). doi: 10.1109/MS.2008.48

  * Read the book chapter on product management [**PRMAN**] (download pdf on internal moodle page) Fricker, Samuel A. "Software product management." Software for People. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2012. 53-81. pdf

  * Read the paper on release planning [**RP**] (download pdf on internal moodle page) Ruhe, Gunther, and Moshood Omolade Saliu. "The art and science of software release planning." IEEE software 22.6 (2005): 47-53.  doi: 10.1109/MS.2005.164

  * **Write down** at least three quality requirements relevant to your course project.
